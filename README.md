# LifeGame_and_Mines
My version of Lifegame and Mines Game in python code

The reason that I put these two together is that they share a lot similarities. 
The Mines are developed from the LifeGame code.
An icon file is included for distribution of the mines code. 
An exe version of Mines.py is included. (pyinstaller -F -w -i mines.ico mines.py)
Run and solve it!
